# Typewriter Animation made with CSS3

The animation uses the `::before` and `::after` pseudo elements. It is composed of 2 animations:
- `typewriter` - The animation moves left until it gets to `left: 100%;` 
- `blink` - The animation changes the background from `transparent` to a solid color, which creates a blinking effect.
